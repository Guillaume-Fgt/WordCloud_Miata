so when we were starting development of

the the nd the new program manager for

this car Yamamoto son he really had this

vision of going back to the original

concept of being a really pure

lightweight sports car and that was sort

of music to our ears in the u.s. that's

what we'd been trying to push the car

toward the whole time and so we were we

can't take credit for pushing the car

there but because his his vision was if

anything more pure than ours was in

terms of getting the car small and light

and simple so he wanted it so simple

that it was going to have you know a

tiny little 1.5 liter engine globally as

well which was sort of the one place

where we differentiated from him but one

of the the biggest sort of departures

was as we were trying to get the car to

drive dynamically as much I can in a

Miata as we could visually we wanted to

look totally different and and that came

from sort of revisiting who that the

customers were for the car and what how

well the car was perceived in the world

outside of our customers so as as Miata

enthusiasts we see the Miata as as a

pure sports car and when we look at at

the NA we see sort of a pure

distillation of a 60s roadster what a

lot of the general public sees in today

is a cute eagle beach cruiser

I sort of delineated em a and B and see

differentiation between first two ii ii

ii ii the third fourth well fortunately

unfortunately i never had to do it I

left Mazda by then I got a phone call

from them say we're gonna start the

fourth generation I said whoo I did the

first three but not necessary fourth but

I say look 100 yards away

has to be me and you know recognized as

a Miata

years away and I think the final came

it's exactly that you recognize it right

away right as Indy but still within

overall Miata sort of family look and we

really wanted to sort of break that and

how people stop making fun of this

little Secretary's car and have them

have everybody recognize it as a sports

car and getting the design sort of

direction to change to a more aggressive

path took introducing the Japanese team

to the way the cars perceived here in

the US because in Japan everyone

recognizes it for the sports car that it

is and and they didn't realize that it

kind of gets people looked down my nose

is that the car in some circles here so

we had to get him together with a bunch

of of Miata clubs

and we're they were talking want to

understand everything about those owners

experiences but at one point we asked

them you know has anybody ever made fun

of your car and every single person was

like oh yeah people make fun of my car

all the time

they think it's cutesy little nothing

and that was a groundbreaking thing for

the Japanese because they just didn't

have that experience over there I think

for the mxi what's unique about it it's

a very simple easy to understand concept

and in any product or in anything you do

simple is usually the best way to go and

it's a very clear focus for what the

vehicle is and that carried through from

the first gen to the second gen and the

third gen and now even in the fourth gen

and obviously it's been successful we've

sold over a million of them over the you

know the 30 years the car has been in

production and we'll continue to follow

that same philosophy of keeping it very

simple and very pure and very easy to

understand

one of the things that I thought about

was the Motorsports part of it that kind

of popped up out of nowhere it which

seemed to surprise everybody Spec Miata

and the cop car collaboration right with

long road now that you're into the NC

and the nd which are now being raised

and the most raced grassroots

Motorsports vehicles in the world right

when you started to develop the nd how

much was the Motorsports part of that

car was it really baked into the overall

design at this point or was it car first

Motorsports secondary the the idea for a

global mx-5 Cup was hatched early on

yamamoto was talking about this years

before we had a prototype so it was it

was part of the idea from the beginning

the design for the oiling for the engine

for example is designed to maintain oil

pressure at one point for GE sustained

street cars never doing that so there's

there's stuff like that that's that sort

of baked in from the beginning

anticipating that there's going to be a

race car it kind of gets fuzzy where you

where do you assume that all right the

race cars can have different parts here

we don't to worry about that but we do

have to worry about it here so you know

there's lots of times there's difficult

cost decisions where we can't

necessarily you know put giant brakes or

huge wheel bearings in the car but

something like you know setting a

standard where the the thing has to

maintain oil pressure that is G that

doesn't cost us a whole lot but most if

you're not looking forward you're not

going to realize that you need to do

that so that I know that that vision was

in there from the beginning

[Music]

[Music]

so the best thing to talk about is to

talk about how it drives when you start

to push it and that's where this car

gets to be its true self yes you can

kind of throw it around on the street

and be comfortable in it and it gets

great fuel efficiency you know you can

you could push the high 30 mile per

gallon range if you're just puttering

this around but when you start to drive

it hard you notice that people are like

well you know it needs more horsepower

and I've been one of those people that

said this with the revision to the nd2

motor and now we finally have some revs

so we have the power that kind of didn't

come out

when that 2-liter first launched with

the nd one this new motor you feel a

sense of acceleration it doesn't lug up

a hill it doesn't feel like you're not

going anywhere it builds speed and you

can use all of this and I think that's

my favorite part is you can use all the

horsepower and you can still appreciate

driving this fast without going in

insane speeds where you're gonna lose

your license

people talk about a lot and I I've said

this too is it feels soft the suspension

has a lot more float to it but then you

start to get it when you drive it on

roads like this especially in California

where there's a lot of you know bumps

and dips and changes and camber where

the suspension lifts up and down and if

you were in a really stiff car on bad

pavement it would unsettle it you would

get bump steer you would have more

twitchiness in the rear-end and because

there's so much motion and the

suspension here you don't get any of

that now I've talked to other owners as

well that have had all the generations

and there's truth to the fact that this

is not as whimsical feeling as the NA

and the NB it feels a lot more serious

it feels more purpose-built for driving

and I for one can appreciate just how

special that is because all the true

drivers cars are starting to disappear

you're getting in the market you're

getting the weight you're getting these

more touring GT cars and you're getting

high horsepower which is a lot of fun

but you can't again I talk about this

all the time you can't utilize all of

that in a safe manner on most every

public road but in two three seconds

most of the time you're you're maxed out

the speed limit and you know it becomes

kind of a safety risk and a kill it just

it kills your ability to have fun we're

this I mean if you have roads like this

of course you can utilize almost all the

power that's available to you here and

then some

everything about this feels like it's

been tweaked and massaged and totally

refined everything about it gives you

this sense of adrenaline rush and fun

you feel so connected to this car and

every single measure that you can't and

most at most of anything under $70,000

these days

now cars are getting better and it's

true the Miata has kind of lost out to

some of the horsepower Wars but there's

a reason why this car has been around

for 30 years and there's nothing else

that's been able to compete with it and

there's nothing else like it in an

affordable price range

[Music]

all right Dave Coleman again Here I am

underneath the in D the indeed me out it

was one of the first ones I actually got

to be involved with sort of from the

beginning from the concept stage this

car was really a kind of a return to the

purity of the original car the car we

benchmarked the most in developing this

car was the in a Miata we really wanted

to get back to the simplicity and light

weight of that car the the program

manager young motifs on was really

really adamant about this being as light

as possible and this car also kind of

benefited in the same way as the NA from

some delays both this car and the NA

were delayed a year or two from their

original launch timing and that gave

more time to sort of dial things in and

sort things out and really refine the

car and shape more grams out of it then

than would have been possible otherwise

so the big recession kind of delayed a

lot of programs and should have

stretched the ANC's life cycle a little

bit a little bit longer so we got a lot

more time to really sort of talk things

through

on this car so we really shrunk discard

down on every measurable dimension on

the outside but kept the interior space

and sort of dimensionally the same but

made this shape smarter so that humans

fit in it better I fit in an Indy a lot

better than I fit in NC and I'm sort of

right at the edge of who fits in one of

these cars what you can see underneath

the car obviously is a lot of aluminum a

lot of the structural ideas are the same

remember this butterfly brace that was

on the NC it's a whole lot lighter now

dozen lumen 'm there was a structural

panel underneath the middle of the

subframe here on the NC that was steel

it's aluminum now but thick enough

aluminum to really act as a sheer panel

the control arms are even lighter even

more forged aluminum than they were

before but they've got aluminum uprights

now weird details that I didn't realize

mattered as much as I do at first the

orientation of this this bushing

on the back of the control arm you'll

notice on the end see the bolt goes

through vertically and it just sort of

twists a rubber bushing this way now

it's this way we're rotating the bushing

around it doesn't seem like it should

matter on a double wishbone car that

does matter a lot and the reason is not

immediately obvious when you push up on

the wheel the the spring and shock are

holding down in somewhere in the middle

of the control arm so there's a reaction

force down at the bushing and when the

the bushing is it's this way it has a

lot more axial travel and so when you

hit a bump it's kind of this undamped

shaking here and it actually puts some

limitations on how you can tune the

suspension when you're trying to prevent

this this shake whereas the bushing is a

lot stiffer in this orientation on a

strut car where the the spring and shock

are right on the knuckle it doesn't

matter you can orient the bushing either

way but on a wishbone car this was a

really big deal to get this oriented the

right way so that's something I learned

from the from the smart guys in Japan so

back here under the middle of the car

there's a lot of interesting stuff going

on here this sort of corner here where

the footwell meets the engine bay was a

really sort of important area that sort

of refined things and get anything

squeezed in we're trying to pull the

engine back as far as we can so it came

back even farther and lower than it was

in the NC but at the same time we're

trying to protect the driver space and

in fact we're sort of reprioritizing

things in getting the driver's seating

position really symmetrical so the

driving position is such that your left

and right foot are equally spaced around

the center line of your body and you're

not offset of any for the transmission

tunnel in the u.s. that wasn't super

noticeable in the earlier cars in Japan

it was very noticeable for some reason

you notice being offset in that

direction I think because you have to

have a dead pedal and in the clutch

pedal and so your driving position when

you're actually using the clutch is

farther offset whereas on the

in the US with our gas pedal up against

the tunnel it wasn't quite as obvious

that our driving position was offset but

with this generation of cars would

really refocus on getting the driving

position perfectly symmetrical and ideal

and that meant getting this corner kind

of pushed down so we can get the pedals

where they need to be which is really

fighting for space with the exhaust and

the catalytic converter and the subframe

mounts and the engine mounts and the

suspension and so you can see if you

look closely the exhaust it's really

tightly packaged and there's a couple of

really sort of aggressive bends in it to

get it to all fit in here at the same

time this original design was designed

around a 1.5 liter and having enough

room for a 1.5 liters exhaust and the

smaller engine up there and we had sort

of rammed the 2 litre into it relatively

late in development so is a real

packaging challenge to get this corner

of the car to work out but the driving

position really sort of pays off so that

was I think one of the benefits of

delaying the program and also know

there's a new transmission in here this

in in the era where everything is

automatic transmission dual clutch

everything nobody will ever develop a

new manual transmission again we took a

perfectly good 6-speed manual

transmission threw it out and designed

another 6-speed manual transmission in

chasing pounds out of this car designing

a completely new transmission let us do

two things took 15 pounds out of the

transmission for one which is not an

insignificant amount of weight but also

really rethought the way the gear ratios

are laid out and structured so that one

we lay out a much simpler shifter so we

don't have this little sort of rocker

arm and one of the shift throws that

they made this shift action a little bit

heavier so it has a lighter more direct

shift feel but also your typical

rear-wheel drive transmission will have

a one to one fourth gear it's sometimes

a fifth gear and this goes back to the

fact that a lot of five-speed manuals

and even 6-speed manual two are designed

around designs that were originally for

speeds and back then you put it in

fourth gear that was your that was your

cruisin gear and a direct one-to-one

gear is the most efficient one you don't

put

loads of any gears so there's a lot less

driveline drag with a six-speed

transmission of course you're cruising

gear is six here yours passing through

fourth on the way so the one that's

going to have an impact on the cars

efficiency and fuel economy is six here

so weary geared the whole thing so sixth

gear is one to one and then to make the

ratios work out you have to have a

wildly different gear ratio in the back

then we're used to so you're used to

something around three point nine four

four point one as a final drive back at

the back of the cart you could be

forgiven for thinking that we carried

over the rear suspension from the NC cuz

it's got five links that you can't

figure out by looking at them again but

actually the geometry is very different

and sort of came at things from a

different different angle I mentioned

before that we had two different kinds

of passive steering in the back of one

of these suspensions there's the

compliance steer from the bushings

deflecting and there's the kinematic

steer from the body roll and the nce had

a trick that was carried over from the

rx-8 where the compliance steer would

tow it out and the the roll steer would

tow it back in the idea being that as

you turn in the first thing that happens

is you get a slide that on the tire so

that steering happens first and that in

the long wheelbase rx-8 would help kind

of rotate the back of the car into the

corner and then as the body rolled it

would tow back in Andry stabilize it so

it'd give you a nimble turn in and a

more stable exit that also kind of

weirded some people out they turn in and

they have that little bit of instability

and they make them nervous so we kind of

flipped the script on that and put both

of those steering to toe in so as you

turn in it would stabilize a little bit

and as it rolled would stabilize a

little bit more and that kind of works

better with sort of the feedback loop

between the car and the driver where you

you're making an input expecting some

result getting the results you expect

and and sort of following through with

it so as we sort of focused more and

more on on the driver rather than the

mechanics of what the car was doing we

started coming to different solutions

that that made the car more natural and

easier to drive fast

a couple other things you'll notice back

here is the the way that the subframe is

designed if you look all the way back to

an na and NB the diff bolted into the

bottom of the subframe and there were

some structure that hang would hang down

and the arms

attached to that and those structures

could sort of Bend when you put a

cornering load on them so later years

they started putting braces across those

underneath the diff if you look at the

way the subframe is designed on the Indy

now the main structure of the subframe

he's in line with the main lateral links

so the cornering load comes straight in

through here and is braced directly with

this so the from the viewpoint of where

the cornering loads are coming into the

subframe it's much much more rigid so

it's much more sort of weight efficient

putting the putting the structure where

it needs to be for the cornering loads

so I talked about how we saved a bunch

of weight off the transmission at that

end that this end the diff actually I

think we saved about another 15 pounds

off the diff as well and that's about

all I can remember about the back of

this car here so let's go up to an

engine bay and talk about what's up

there alright so here we are under the

hood of the Indy if you remember the

Tupperware spaghetti mess that was under

the NC this is looks a lot more like a

traditional engine bay and this was will

put a lot of work into making sure this

really looked like something sort of

classic where you could tell the engine

from all the other hoses and stuff not a

lot of engine Bay's actually look like

engines anymore those have covers on

them this is a real departure because

you know every little bit of this car

was designed to save weight this costs

more and weighs more than a plastic

valve cover

but it's aluminum because that's just

the right thing to do in a sports car

and we finally decided to do it one

thing you'll see is there was a big

difference in the engines output from

the Indy ones of the Indy - we did a

recent update to the engine and

dramatically increase the power a lot of

that comes from the fact that this

wasn't planned in the car in the first

place so all the development money was

allocated to the 1.5 liter that was

based on the 1.5 that was in a Mazda 2

and then they put forged crank and rods

into it different cams and different

manifolds and big reports and made it

revved higher make more power once we

finally kind of collected it some more

engineering budget to go in and do what

we did with the 1.5 - this that's where

we got the big power bomb now the the

funny thing is that all of the internal

documents

around the development of this engine

would never mention the fact that was

gonna make more power the whole purpose

of this engine was to make it rev higher

and be smoother and have that feel of

being able to just wring out the motor

it take it to 7,500 rpm and really enjoy

the top end of the rev range that's

where the enjoyment is for this car we

didn't actually know how much more power

the thing had until we were getting

marketing documents when the cars were

on boats like it was not a thing all of

the effort behind this car is making it

feel right and and you know the sort of

American obsession with horsepower we

translate that into oh my god I got 25

horsepower but really what happened is I

got 15 of your ribs on the top of the

power band that's that's what mattered

to us and you see that we finally did

lose the power steering pump that used

to be over there on the NC we finally

relented and went back to electric power

steering this time whereas the rx-8 had

this electric motor wrapped around the

steering rack that would only work if

you had a super short rotary engine this

has a dual pinion rack where your

steering pinion over here coming from

your steering shaft and there's another

opinion on the other side of the rack

with a motor on it so as you turn the

wheel the motor turns to to assist you

and the reason we put the assist down

there where every other car that we make

has the assist up on the steering column

is because the amount of torque going

through the steering shaft is a lot less

and so the shaft itself doesn't deflect

you have a more direct steering response

when you have a low torque steering

shaft and all the assist is right on the

rack so I think the end result of this

sort of obsession with the way the

engine feels in the way it revs has

really given us one of the the best

feeling naturally aspirated motors that

it's out there now most modern engines

are so focused on low-end torque it was

just you know fine for really good for

your daily drivability as a sports car

you want to build a rev it out and

really sort of enjoy that part of the

power band and so a lot of ways this

engine kind of feels like a throwback to

sort of the the great 90s of high rev

engine

but with the the refinement and

efficiency that we have with with modern

direct injection and all that

[Music]

you've reached the conclusion of this

video series I've driven every

generation Miata I've had a chance to

talk to some of the key people in the

United States that helped kickstart this

car design it from its inception to tell

their story the cars story and some of

the Japanese perspective and certain

people ask well what about this sub

model what about the Mazda speed Miata

what's the story with that and I can't

cover every single thing but what I will

say is a huge thanks to Mazda North

American for allowing me to do this to

have access to these vehicles to try to

talk talk about and tell the story and a

huge thanks to the patreon that make

this possible because a video series

like this it's really not about the

views this is not going to be some

popular mind-blowing thing it's going to

have a limited scope and it's costly and

time consuming compared to just you know

quantity type material so if you want to

see more get on the patreon side I'm

going to release more extended

interviews and all of that for you but

the biggest takeaway from this one of

the biggest reasons why I wanted to do a

video like this or videos like this some

people have a better understanding of

how why cars like this exist and are

they viable for the future and I have to

say from the Mazda perspective I'm

shocked at this car that the nd Miata

was even created because this is one of

the very few if not one of the last

because cars like this are becoming

extinct that were designed for

enthusiasts that are on a dedicated

architecture platform that's not shared

out with an SUV CUV

another car it's its own vehicle and

that is so expensive and so

time-consuming to make for that hand few

of people that actually buy them I don't

know the only way to fund projects like

this is to sell a kajillion other cars

and a smaller company like Mazda doesn't

do that compared to other ones so I

really hope that this car exists in

another 30 years or 60 years and my

great grandkids can be talking about it

like I'm talking about today but if not

try to get in one of these I don't care

what generation and really appreciate

how special it is and how few vehicles

like it exists

and then the last part to talk about is

what is the best Miata people ask me

this all the time well you drove them

all and I'm gonna say this it depends on

what generation you come from in your

driving experience I've talked to the

older people I've talked to younger

people and the older crowd that grew up

or was alive during the time when the na

and NB were released and being designed

they have an affinity towards that car

that was the first me out of the real

Miata and subsequent the end see the nd

it's not the same and then you get into

the younger crowd maybe first Carly

drove as an NC or an nd for me my very

first Miata experience was in a Mazda

speed Miata and I'd already been tainted

by an s2000 so it's kind of like I don't

really see it but getting into the nd in

the NC objectively they are far better

performance cars but the NA and the NB

have this purity to them because they

were trying to emulate that of the old

British sports car this whimsical simple

open feeling that you don't get from

newer cars and it's kind of split it's

up to who you are to decide which Miatas

for you

I'll take an nd to me out on any day I

think it's amazing for what it is and

how its evolved from the start and kind

of gone back is just something I have

yet to driven in any type of affordable

price it's a special car if you get your

hands on one and if you can afford it

check it out but thank you so much for

watching this series I'll catch you next

time

you
