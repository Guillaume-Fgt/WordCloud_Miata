the second-generation Mazda Miata or the

NB this was a follow-up to the wildly

popular first generation model and Mazda

wanted to take what worked and improve

certain things and we had a chance to

talk with one of the lead designers on

the car about the mechanical aspects the

stylistic approach and more so let's get

started

[Music]

your street

[Music]

you grew up in New York so my father was

into cars my brother's into cars we'd go

to a lot of the car races up at Watkins

Glen and at Lime Rock and so ever since

I can remember I mean five six years old

I was drawing cars and that's all I ever

wanted to do is be a car designer so I

went to Art Center and graduated and got

a job they hired me right out of school

at Chrysler and I spent the first three

and a half years of my career at

Chrysler and there I was part of the LH

program and I got to work on the Viper

so for me I've always you know I've been

passionate about cars I've loved racing

since I was a kid I was inspired by

Chaparrals & McLaren's and Formula one

cars of the air and so I just there was

just something to me about the way a car

looks that's really elicits a very

emotional an emotional response from me

and an emotional kind of feeling that I

get inside when I see just a

good-looking car the mx-5 in a lot of

ways is is iconic for Mazda we just set

out to make it the best front-engine

rear-drive sports car you could make for

the money if you put your passion and

your heart into it in a strong belief in

what a vehicle should be and you don't

compromise you end up developing cars

that become iconic

[Music]

so when I was a Chrysler I actually

bought a 90 Miata brand-new from

showroom and took a lot of heat at Maz

at Chrysler at the time because of

course in that period of time the

Chrysler LeBaron was considered the

best-selling convertible and in the

United States and what ad what's this

little car doing with very simple door

panels and simple seats and it didn't

have diamond took you know leather seats

or anything in it but for me it was the

essence of what the car was about it was

fun to drive you could put the top down

and in five seconds at a traffic light

so when I got to Mazda to descend got

the opportunity to design the NB I

thought it was like a perfect transition

for me coming from where I was coming

from having owned a first-gen car having

lived with the car for five or six years

and then getting the OP getting the

opportunity to design me and be so I

knew what the car was about I knew the

essence of the car I knew what I wanted

to keep on the car I knew what I wanted

to change so I think for at the time Tom

Matano was the father of the mx-5

he knew that he saw that that you know

you're not coming in and trying to make

it something different you understand

the essence of the car and this purity

of the car but as a young designer you

also come up with kind of some fresh

approach some fresh thinking in all

honesty probably didn't feel like I

needed to change a lot but there were a

lot of technical reasons why we needed

to make changes obviously the car had

been out for seven years and it needed

to get updated we realized what the NA

while a huge success that it was there

were a few areas on the car that needed

to get a little bit we evolved if you

will and some of them where the car

needed to become a little bit more

masculine not too much so we didn't want

to turn it into sort of this bodybuilder

sort of physique look we thought we had

a philosophy of making it more like

somebody training for a triathlon where

they're in good shape but they're still

lean but they're a little bit more

muscular so that was that was kind of

the approach we took to making it a

little bit more masculine than the na+

we also new regulations were coming

online that we weren't going to be

allowed to have pop-up headlights

anymore for pedestrian impact and other

require

and also from a pure engineering

standpoint the engineers always felt

that that was weight that was out ahead

of the front wheels that wasn't

perfectly from a perfect balance

standpoint wasn't ideal wasn't a huge

negative to the car but it wasn't ideal

from a weight distribution standpoint

and as I said with the team in place

giving the responsibility to do was a

huge responsibility and it was a huge

task for me to take on but also having

these guys looking over my shoulder

knowing that you know I'm I'm messing

around with their their babies so to

speak

the NB Miyata the second-generation it's

been restyled in hopes to inject some

testosterone into this car to try to

help shed its image of being a little

bit too soft and a little bit too

effeminate the main thing is you have a

1.8 liter here and when you get go back

to back from the 1.6 liter to the 1.8

it's incredible how much more powerful

this thing seems and including the

torque you don't have to completely

whine the piss out of it until you get

into something like this

you feel like you're going a hundred

miles an hour but you're barely breaking

50 and that's one of the reasons why the

Miatas are so good and it carries over

to the end beat you still have a

naturally aspirated motor you have

simple and easy-to-use controls and

anybody that gets behind the wheel of

this immediately feels comfortable it's

so easy to drive I think that's the main

thing about this that surprises me all

this time removed it's still enjoyable

to drive

[Music]

what it maintains over the original na

Miata is almost every single thing that

made that car good it's soft compliant

comfortable it's not razor sharp to the

point where if the car gets unsettled

over a bump it doesn't bump steer and

oversteer everywhere you know exactly

kind of what the car is doing and that's

partly why it's so fun to drive and so

approachable for most every single

person that gets behind the wheel of

this and the biggest thing for me is the

improvement in the steering now it feels

like when you turn the wheel the car

actually turns without you having to

turn it over almost one continuous cycle

to get the thing to turn it feels a lot

more like what you expect from a modern

car and there's some feedback in the

wheel when you go over some bumps yeah

okay you feel things through the

steering wheel you know that you're

going over some rough pavement the

biggest thing for me is this is just so

comfortable and compliant there's a lot

of roll which means you can take it off

to back roads that aren't particularly

maintained well and still enjoy driving

it it's a treat that the enemy otta I

mean basically was there and carried

over into this generation

[Music]

fundamentally the car had a very simple

theme this lightweight sports and we

never got away from that and I think

regardless of what other brands did

they're trying to copy us and kind of

embellish it or enhance areas that we're

not necessarily doing they asked to

thousands an example of just a lot more

horsepower and a much stretch aesthetic

if you will much more Cabrio would

proportion and they were successful for

that segment but I don't think people

cross shopped s2000s with mx-5

necessarily they were kind of different

breed sort of same two-seat rear drive

convertibles but with us yeah we

certainly looked at the competition but

we also knew we had a really good

formula so we didn't run around chasing

after what other companies were doing

other companies did that to us certainly

when we brought the mx-5 out but I don't

think any of our successful because

there wasn't this purity of what they

were trying to do and I think with the

mx-5 there was a purity of concept that

fundamentally ran through the NA through

the nd and I think that's why we were

successful and we didn't chase after we

were told at one point that the Solstice

was going to be the best-selling

convertible ever and it turned out not

to be and for the N be again that was my

challenge of designer was keeping it

pure making it better but not straying

too far from what made the NA so

successful with with the end B we also

because the vehicle got a little wider

we wanted to pull the track out so the

suspension was modified slightly

fundamentally it was the same suspension

setup but the DA arms were wider so the

car had a wider track to give it a more

stable stance some from a budget

perspective we knew we had to use sort

of a carry over a lamp inner or a lamp

bucket as we call it and again we wanted

to make the light as small as possible

but there's only so much technology at

that time lamp technologies didn't

hadn't developed like it has today with

LEDs and halogens and

and HID lamps so we really were focused

on making the lamp look as small as

possible and that was probably the

biggest challenge was to keep the

profile of the hood keep the line in the

basic gesture of the mx-5 of DNA but

also having these fixed headlamps now in

place and so we worked really hard at

making them as small as possible and

getting him again to fit the profile of

the car have the turn signal in there

have the high beam in the low beam so

that was one challenge the other

challenge was we did we didn't get a lot

of complaints on the first car but we

did get some comments from people about

women were breaking their fingernails on

the you know the very iconic door handle

let the NA head so there were two

approaches one was yes that was a

cost-saving to carry over a door handle

from another production car that for me

was a challenge because I felt that was

one of the most iconic parts of the

vehicle was was the really cool you know

chrome door handle that was one of the

challenges we fought that for a long

time but eventually the project manager

and the budgeting issues came into play

and so we had to use what was an

existing carry over door handle but that

and the headlight were probably the two

biggest challenges and then because of

the success of the first car we kept the

beltline was the same the wind chill was

the same this side you know the side

window is the same and working from a

design standpoint some of that is

restrictive but on the other hand that's

the challenges of designer is having

some of these requirements in place that

you'd then have to work around and make

sure that the design is still as

successful as it turned out to be and as

beautiful as you wanted it to be without

it's sacrificing too much of the overall

design concept
