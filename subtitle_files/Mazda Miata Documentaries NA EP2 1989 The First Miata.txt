the first car in this series celebrating

the 30th anniversary of the Miata is the

NA the first generation car I'm standing

in front of the one of the first three

ever made red white and blue which were

shown at the Chicago Auto Show for the

first time now there is a ton of history

on these cars we talked to some of the

people involved with this we look at the

underbody the engineering behind it and

we get it out for a drive to kind of

show you what it's like after all of

this time

[Music]

in my name is James Kilbourne I'm

currently accessory analyst back in the

80s I was fortunate enough to work on

the first generation mx-5 program well

it's amazing that we're here today right

now in the original forsake studio

there's a mezzanine up here where Mark

Jordan and shin were working back in the

day and also this is one of the first

areas where we actually started doing

initial clay modeling in the company

this is really the original room where

the mx-5 was was really created and the

initial clay modeling was performed so

when I joined a Mazda in 1982 I sort of

you know working with Bob Hall and he

had this idea of having this lightweight

sports and subsequently we hired mark

Jordan a designer and we also had a

Japanese designer mark yagi that we was

dispatched here from Japan Bob was kind

of relentless about trying to get this

vehicle produce so due to his persistent

nature

yagi son and Mark started sketching

renderings for the car and probably

about a year later Tom Matano joined on

board bob and i actually the other day i

reflect upon it I met him like 1972 Auto

Expo in LA in a convention center and

and then I went to the show and in the

back of the show this guy the

blond-headed guy reading Japanese

magazines and I missed up ticket that

was my favorite magazine but being in

the States for a couple of years I

I was missing that magazines I went out

them can I take a look at that magazine

he kind of replied in Japanese said okay

go ahead so we started become a friend

and he said I got more magazine our home

or vice versa so we start becoming a

good friend so that was like 72 so you

know way before all this thing happened

following that there was actually a

competition between the Japanese

Hiroshima studio and the Yokohama studio

in Japan and there was actually three

different concepts one was a

front-engine front drive that was the

proposal from Hiroshima and then in

Yokohama they had a midship car similar

to an mr2 and then our car was a

front-engine rear-drive vehicle so there

was a competition I can't remember the

year exactly but there was a Hiroshima

kind of competition per se and everybody

gravitated towards the front-engine

rear-drive car that we had assembled or

produced and at that point in time we

were pretty you know certain that we

were gonna get the thumbs up to continue

developing the models and and get an

additional second and third clay done

which then eventually turned into to

where we ended up with the first

generation car okay for one day like mr.

food and I decided the car didn't really

have the personality that we want it so

he went on on the front and start

shaping clay and I went on the rear

start shaping the clay you know like we

are not like we're not looking at each

other just starting from the rear and

he's studying from front and then some

have come to the near the middle when we

stood up you know get off the the stand

out and back and and both got exactly

the same flavor I mean that's how close

the week mr. Quinn and I became on

what we need it to have you know I mean

that's not a sketch or anything we just

felt it the car should have a certain

personality see again if one of the

ingredients are missing wouldn't have

happened the inspiration behind the mx-5

really was due to Bob Paul's passion for

two-seat British sports cars the rx-7

also was kind of internally a very core

vehicle for that inspiration the success

of the first generation rx-7 was was

kind of paramount internally at the

company also you know how well the

vehicle was doing in EMSA racing at the

time so that gave us a lot of

inspiration there was a a Triumph

Spitfire that was sent to Japan years

ago in that late 70s and I know that

konnichi Yamamoto actually drove that

car and got you know inspiration about

what we were talking about and then

later on probably in the about the mid

80s we sent a Lotus Elan s2 to Japan to

send over there to the guys like if you

guys can recreate this performance and

kind of this fun-to-drive aspects of

this little this little s2 Lotus Elan

then you know we're gonna have a home

run and now and then we pretty much did

I mean I think the the performance on

the Miata maybe suffered a little bit

compared to that but overall I mean we

were really surprised when the car

finally got me a pilot production cars

over here back in the the late 80s it

was a cycle my god this thing's home run

they did a great job and you know and I

mean the part of that makes me think

like yeah because we sent that Elan over

there I think that's what horizon

probably really really studied that car

really well and Colin Chapman you know

we could probably got to take Colin

Chapman for some of that yeah I don't

know whether we explained to you mister

here ie was a chief engineer he when he

was a sign he came to me says look I

never knew anything about a sports cars

I never drove one

you know I haven't done anything but

they assigned to me so I'm gonna put my

life into this project so tell me what

exactly you want to do the great part of

it looking back is he has no

preconceived notion on his own so

whatever we told him to do he replicated

as best as he can you know in his way so

we talked about gear shift you know the

wrist motion he try and try and trying

to find that best possible way that's

why he's we couldn't believe that he

delivered that shift you know feeling of

a shift we we pitched it but we never

thought that's gonna happen to that

level for example right and I said

exhaust note is very important well he

says send us a sound I said no you had

to feel it on your heart the American

feels vibration not just sound through

the year you needed that but he never

showed up but they've really he recorded

all different sounds and clinic it

defined two or four three final sound

that people think it's a little red

sports car and he dissected that

wavelengths in every mid-range you know

and find a common thread on those three

sound he created that combination all

that to make a mere a tailpipe sound

again he has no conceived notion so he

had to find a way in a scientific his

engineer way to reproduce it so that

again it's a fortunate if we have

another guy did a prior rx-7 or

something became a chief engineer could

never happen I think the first reason

the car works so well was because of an

affordability that was a key a key

aspect of the car that the styling of

the car was another thing that I think

you know that the front long front nose

and the short decklid gave you that

traditional kind of British sports car

styling and I think that's one of them

really strong appeal points and then

also I think

this the overall vehicle dynamics due to

the light weights the dynamics of the

car is exceptional and again you'll

you'll you'll discover that when you and

you get behind the wheel of the car

[Music]

[Music]

I'm setting off in one of the first

three Miatas ever made and this has

eighty nine hundred miles on the clock

which technically this is brand new it

is extremely weird to drive this in some

ways in other ways it just makes sense I

think the thing for me is you realize

how comfortable this is and the only

thing that's particularly different

about it is it's on the residues just

you know a pretty aggressive compound

for a car like this of its this of the

era so you hear some tiger noise from

that and it might increase the stiffness

slightly but this car rides so soft so

comfortably I can see why it was so

popular to drive every day the main

thing to me that is a complete standout

are two things the transmission there is

an insane mechanical feel here in fact

when you first start this up you notice

right away how nachi first second third

gear are until you get heat in the

transmission before those gears engaged

smoothly once you get the transmission

up the temperature this has to be one of

the best feeling transmission manual

transmissions I've been in in a long

time it just it makes you feel so

connected to the car you're actually

doing something

when you're throwing a gear in place the

steering on the other hand is the total

opposite I mean it's a manual steering

rack but it is so slow and sloppy it's

got that 90s car like imprecision to it

when you turn there's just so much body

motion the front end is the front part

of the car and the back end of the car

don't particularly respond that quick

but that's also why this this car feels

so good over all these different

pavement types

ah there's this whimsical feeling to it

it's so open

it feels so light and small that you can

get it anywhere and do anything with it

now in terms of drivability when you're

on the highway one of the things that I

thought was hilarious is at about 70

miles an hour in fifth gear because it's

only a 5-speed manual you're revving at

about 4,000 rpms and you know that this

was a today's era car the best part

would be all you know you have nine

gears you'd be at 1,000 rpms

where's you're sitting here at 4,000

rpms you feel like there's something

wrong with it and this is just how how

things in the gearing was back in the

day now in terms of acceleration you

know you got to kind of go back

it's just a four-cylinder that you have

to wind out there's no peaking as to it

there's no variable valve timing where

you feel like this pickup of

acceleration when you hit the higher end

it's just you sit there and wait for it

to rev out and it's not you know it's

definitely slow compared to modern

standards you know this is that's one of

the things you're gonna notice right

away but that's also part of the charm

of the older four cylinders you had to

work them more to get the rewards but as

this stands I feel like the big thing

for me is I appreciate this because of

the simplicity and the design of it and

just how damn comfortable it is to drive

around it's it's like something that's

disappeared it really it's just the only

thing that really recreates this is the

end Amiata and even that feels a little

bit more intimidating it feels more

fitted tighter than this does and I feel

like I could literally Drive this all

day long and never feel a bit of fatigue

assuming that the weather was good

the enemy oughtta you drew it up

you knew the people involved with coming

up with it so how from an engineering

perspective did the architecture get

designed in a no in a way where the

company could afford to make this

dedicated product well basically the

initial beginnings were based off the X

508 actually 77 GLC was the beginning

and then Mazdas technical research

department they take they took a rx-7

rear axle and cobbled that together and

that was kind of the the very very early

early on you know non-running prototype

vehicle decided that they're gonna use

the 1.6 liter engine the b6 but they

knew that they needed to improve the

powertrain so they incorporated a

aluminum oil pan they reconfigured the

cylinder head to include larger intake

valves and also you know we those types

of improvements would would improve the

high speed breathability of the engine

change the co engine code of the of the

power train from b6 to b6 ze and so

that's actually the the the final engine

code for the mx-5 as for the

transmission the the first [ __ ] was

actually based off our x7 but because

the rotary engine has more wider power

band and torque they actually had to

change the internal gear ratio so they

made a much more close ratio

transmission gears in the mx-5 and they

also changed the shifter because it was

more of a longer throw kind of for the

rx-7 and they actually shortened it up

quite a bit for the mx-5 and it's

actually well known for its real clicky

Nachi

shift linkage which is actually one of

the the joys of driving the car putting

in perspective designing a sports car

today versus back 30 years ago I spoke

with multiple people different engineers

and designers how they say it's so

difficult now to produce a sports car

because you have regulations crash

structure electronics all the things

that go into it that compromise the

overall design so I wanted to know from

your perspective when the NA was being

designed did you have a lot of the

difficulties was it easier than to do

this type of project even

computerization was way less done so it

was more of a manual process so was it

easier than versus now yeah I believe it

was easier than compared to now it's

more of a challenge these days with more

stricter emission regulations and safety

regulations so I believe that it was the

right time I guess to develop the the

inning and and and we were fortunate I

guess in the sense that it probably was

easier back then and it's probably more

challenging today to to develop for

example the nd than it was back then to

develop DNA well the hardest part of the

car you know because we have product

design shoe design the lead time is what

three months and for seasonal design

they have to create for example cars are

like four five years into the future and

you have to predict it in another five

years to to the next one so it's a

longevity of really looking into the

future is more critical than any other

industries so again to me the Miata

project is all sort of happening in a

right moment the right place with all

the connection of people gather together

in that one time all of us get together

used to look through the magazines and

the thing is all the cars we want is

either way expensive that we can afford

or there are those that we could afford

but they are way too old you know like

if yet a fifth one to four alpha male

all these cars are not being developed

further than 10-15 years prior so we

need to have a modern technology latest

reliable sports car that we can afford

there nothing on the market
