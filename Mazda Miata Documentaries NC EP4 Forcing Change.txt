the third-generation Miata or the NC was

released in 2005 and was available all

the way up until 2015 this is one of the

most controversial Miatas to be released

because it started to grow in size

weight and luxury and there's many

reasons for this good and bad and we're

gonna talk about that with Dave Coleman

from Mazda about some of the engineering

design and overall look and style of

this vehicle

[Music]

[Applause]

I'm Dave Coleman I'm the manager of

vehicle dynamics at Mazda North America

and I got to work on both the NC and the

indeed Miata

so we progressed from the NV Miata to

the NC Miata talk me through the

internal mindset of the company at that

time period as the NC was being

developed and some of the things that

were going on

well yeah my my employment here at Mazda

started after that car was in the

prototype stage so within the first year

working here I was I got to drive you

know a fully disguised prototype where

actually the sheet metal was done

underneath there but it was all wrapped

in a diaper I didn't even know what it

looked like so I I wasn't actually

involved it you know in the stages

leading up to that but it's important to

remember sort of where the company was

at that time the 90s had not been kind

to Japan and Ford had taken a

controlling stake the company

not that long before the the NC

development started so it was some of

the basic decisions around that car were

built around sort of the Ford's mindset

of the way they do economies of scale

and from their viewpoint of course we

had to use an rx-8 platform or

architecture for that car because

there's no there's no reasonable reason

from their viewpoint that you would have

to small lightweight rear-wheel drive

sports cars on completely different

platforms sort of the flip side of that

though that the the program manager for

that car kijima son he was as deeply

rooted in mazda sports car culture as

you can be he was the guy that designed

the suspension on the ene and MB Miatas

he was the guy that designed the

suspension on the FD and the FC and he

has say every rx-7 every Miata had been

his design so you know he kind of had it

had difficult constraints from a

business perspective but it had sort of

the the the most purest management

behind it to try to make

do with with with those parts and

there's no complaining about rx-8 parts

really mean that's what it was a

dynamically an amazing car it was just

bigger than the Miata

so all that ended up was the car ended

up a little bit larger than everybody

wanted it to be so when we when Mazda

was part of four things were amortized

across the Ford Empire where we would

have a Mazda 3 on the same platform as a

Ford Focus in the same platform as a

Volvo v40 I think it was and and so you

can spread the cost that way when you go

off independent and you you're one of

the smallest our companies there is and

developing cars at this level you have

to think about things differently so we

spread the car the the platforms in a

different direction now so we'll have

the the cx-9 in the cx-5 and all the

mazda6 and all the way back to the

previous generation Mazda 3 we're one

set of architecture we could share

engineering across the platform in that

direction but you get to a car like like

the Miata that's gotta be so purely

focused at a narrow low volume niche you

can't share parts outside of you know

maybe the engine you can't share that

engineering cost with other cars you're

making so you've got to find someone

else who wants to sell a car in that

scale and a way to differentiate those

things enough that they're not going to

step on each other and spread the cost

that way I think it's probably pretty

similar to what BMW Toyota are doing

with the Souper in the c-4 I think you

know the sports car market is relatively

small and engineering costs these days

are quite high and to make a sports car

really good it's got to be on dedicated

sports car platform so you you just

collaborate

[Music]

[Music]

it feels like lightning compared to the

NA and the NB now that's because you

have more displacement here this is so

different it's so different in a more

structurally solid way this feels like a

totally different car a modern car well

you still feel things through the

steering like I've noticed if you hit a

certain divot or a pothole the steering

will kind of jerk or you'll feel that

where is it's more removed on modern

cars now this is kind of the final

edition mx-5 from the NC generation the

25th anniversary edition so this is as

plush as is loaded as you possibly can

get and I feel like I understand what

they were trying to do and some of the

identity crisis that they were going

through during this time period it's a

very relaxed soft cushy ride there's not

an overt sense of direction change it's

a comfortable Cruiser at all periods of

time it doesn't matter what pavement

where's the NA and the NB got a little

bit sketchy you felt a lot more NVH and

vibration through the steering wheel in

the body structure this is far less but

it feels like a much more substantial

and bigger car it doesn't feel as

whimsical now it still retains some of

the best things like the NA n NB did you

could drive it all day long and I think

that's kind of what the people wanted

from this or that's what the people they

Mazda thought people would like but it

lacks kind of that harder edge now Mazda

continued to develop their own manual

transmission for this car and it feels

far less nachi far less mechanical

it is still you know you take for

granted how modern manual transmissions

have kind of fallen down the hill moving

away from any vibration any type of

connectedness sure you get to shift your

own car but you don't feel that that

definite connection this was softened it

doesn't take as much effort it certainly

doesn't feel as more it's grindy to hit

every year but I don't know it's so

satisfying to drive this and then you

get to the motor and I think that's the

big change for me

[Music]

7,500 rpm

and it just winds out so effortlessly

and then you you combine the sound tube

or the sound generator which pumps in

induction releases the cabin in it it

does have a good sense of throat to it

without having to supplement anything

like they do in modern vehicles with the

fake pops and clicks or there's a fake

audio through the speaker's it's a

subtle way of creating character overall

the MC Miata feels much more substantial

it's a solid feeling car but it also

feels more hefty and that's the

sacrifice of trying to co-develop a

rear-wheel drive platform with another

car that is bigger than this does that

mean it lost some of its spirit a little

bit I wouldn't say it's a total

deal-breaker because there's two things

that really stand out here from the NA

and the NB this motor is far superior I

mean you can just wind the piss out of

this thing and again you can do it

within the limits of what you can do on

the street like I could literally just

rip this through second third gear and

not be at over 100 miles an hour like

the higher horsepower cars of today the

second thing is you have eight

arguably one of the better manual

transmissions in the past 15 years it

just feels so good and it makes me sad

to see that so many companies have

stopped developing this I never thought

I'd be saying this I'm under the car

with Dave Coleman and one of your

favorite Mazdas I'm so excited to be

under under a famous Savage Goose I

never got to talk about the enca Miata

now we talked about the undie Miata when

it came out and the NC was this huge

evolution from the NBN on a because this

was a complete rework for the first time

how was that internally for you guys I

know our reaction to it being bigger and

heavier was certainly mixed we were

we're all purists here as you can tell

by the cars we make but it seemed an

inevitability at the time that you know

the old car was old everything was

bigger safety standards were a lot

harder

and for very practical reasons it had to

be based on rx-8 architecture kind of

taken over from where the envy left off

this was a complete ground-up redesign

the first time the Miata got one of

those the na and NB were basically the

same car designed in the 80s and then

sort of evolved evolved evolved over a

lot of years and this was such a clean

slate that at the time I think the only

part that carried over from the NB to

the NC was the little round reflector

light on the fender on the European

models that we don't even get here other

than that it was a completely 100% new

car so as a result the ins he kind of

grew a little bit because I've had to

fit into the shoes of the rx-8 the sub

frames are actually completely

interchangeable between rx-8 and NC when

you get into the details none of the

parts are actually the same though all

the hard points are the same but after

sort of building the car around that

architecture and sort of the Graham

strategy portion of the design where you

go through and just try to find every

little gram you can shave off the car

they realize that the sub creams are

there to be fee the control arms are

heavier than they need to be the wheel

bearings are bigger than the need to be

everything's designed for a bigger

heavier car and it just that not let me

out of philosophy so you just went

through every part of the car and tried

to shave weight out of it so if you lay

like an rx-8 control arm next to an NC

control arm they look the same at first

and you look closely and one of them's

been on a diet everything is a little

bit thinner everything's a little bit

just more optimized and that's because

it didn't have as much weight to carry

around and they drill just gone to the

process of shaving every possible gram

off of it

big change from ena and embiid those

cars had it really sort of they had a

great suspension geometry is that you

know double wishbones but everything was

built from stamped sheet metal control

arms a pretty sort of low cost

construction whereas suddenly we had

this exotic forged aluminum parts on

here if you look I mean you could put

the suspension parts in an art gallery

this is really beautiful stuff on her

here so there was sort of more sort of

investment in fancy equipment

reduce unsprung weight you see there's a

bunch more braces built into the car one

of the things of keeping a convertible

handling well is getting the body

stiffness up as much as you can and that

whole body stiffness versus weight

battle braces across the big open

channels of the car make a big

difference so we had this sort of dog

bone shaped brace underneath the

transmission that you start seeing NBS

would start getting braces in later

years across here because we were there

figuring out that actually this makes a

big difference in the initial steering

response of the car the body flexes

right here in response to turning the

wheel and puts a little bit of delay

into the steering so the NBS would start

getting like in just a tube across here

or something like that and this big

butterfly shaped piece not only braces

across the tunnel but prevents the two

frame rails from moving up and down or

forward aback relative to each other and

then you have this little growth coming

out of the tunnel here to give us a

mounting point for this expert this is

an incredibly light stamped aluminum X

is doing the same thing keeping the left

and right sides of the car from moving

forward back because when you twist the

car the right and left sides go forward

to back well this is you each other and

just your boxing in the tunnel like this

it makes a huge difference that this is

sort of taking the job of what a roof

would do on a fixed roof car of putting

some shear strength into the body so

building these sort of details in from

the beginning from the platform level

really helped really stiff and up the

car and give it more more potential as a

sports car

then the na na and B initially had so

over the course of a lifecycle let's say

on the end C what are the things that

are easily changeable from like you get

your hands on obviously you probably

didn't have your hands on this

specifically at that time period but

when you need to take a look at like

people's complaints owners complaints

and Motorsports complaints or like all

that

what are you what's easy to change is

that bushing compliance is it sway bar

size what do you typically you actually

will see a big change from the NC 172

when we did the facelift on the car

that's when we really

attacks the car and took what we had had

learned from motorsports from our

customers from our own feelings about

the car honestly we had actually built

after the car came out we thought it was

it was too soft there was a sort of

confusion at that time about who the

Miata customer really is because there

is a pure sports car customer for the

car there is a fun convertible customer

for the car the the demographic for the

car was baby boomers who were getting

older because they you know the whole

roadster generation or the Boomers and

so there were we were just going in

every different direction trying to

figure out who this car was for okay and

since we thought it was it was too soft

and it didn't handle as it should

I built a car that we called the one G

car which was a car that would pull one

G on a skid pad on street tires and

still be comfortable it really had the

essence of what we thought it was right

about the car we ended up using that

suspension kit we sold it as I think it

the MSR kit through motorsports we used

it in Skip Barber school cars for a

while it was like a trunk kit for

autocross but the most important thing

we did is the guys back in Japan looked

at I said okay yeah we agree that's

that's a good idea

and then they threw out everything we

did and they did it their way because

they have much better tools at their

disposal over there then we were a very

small team in the US right so they went

through and changed the roll center and

you know change the geometry a little

bit stiffened up the the spring the

spring rate was like 50 or 70 percent

stiffer it was a big change much firmer

damping and really sort of solidified

the car got the roll posture right it

was a little bit kind of the back would

roll more than the front of initially

and they lowered the front rolls in

order to get the roll axis inclination

right which is something we weren't

going to be doing with car parts and

sort of got the character that we were

going after with that car in a very

different way and at that same point

they added some other stuff like put a

oil cooler on the edge

which it didn't have initially so that

you guys who were really driving a thing

hard taking it to the track it would

make it a lot more robust for that kind

of stuff obviously we knew we were gonna

race this we were planning to have a

five cup series with the car it's still

really tricky for the production

engineering guys to really get in the

mindset of what Motorsports need so we

try to feed that back like we're we sit

in the same office in our little Rd

office in the US we said the same room

with the Motorsports guys and we talk to

them all the time so we hear what's

going on and we tell our contacts in

Japan to try to you know get details

right so we had stuff that would that

would wear out in Motorsports that

didn't wear out on the street like the

front wheel bearings would would wear

out on these things on the track and we

wanted to just throw an rx-8 once it'll

bolt in but the ABS sensors were

different and we synced that stuff up

with the nc2 so then for motorsport

ticket just a bolt in an rx-8 pairing

and it would be solid there was a one of

the I think it was the the 3/4 shift

fork instead of being just a straight

shaft to a shift fork there was a chef

than a monkey motion linkage than a

different shot and that linkage would

would break when the guys were racing

that never broke on the street never

broken as yeah there's guys doing stuff

when they're racing that the

transmission guys just weren't

anticipating it so we very quickly

actually before we got tuned into to

change that linkage got that fixed up so

there was sort of a fast feedback loop

with the Motorsports guys

so we're saying underneath the the gear

box here this six-speed was actually a

Mazda design to build a six-speed that

came out of the rx-8 easia the other

also the powerplant frame here is sort

of a unique Mazda thing all of our rear

drive sports cars we connect the diff

and the transmission with the powerplant

frame this idea talking to the the

original na team they actually got that

idea from the Ferrari Daytona which had

a trans axle in the back so there was a

torque tube connecting the two and you

don't you kind of need that with the

trans asked you don't need it

it's a separate transmission and if but

what this does is it takes out a lot of

the backlash among commotion between

those two rubber mounted parts

connecting them together gets you a

sharper throttle response largely

because as you apply torque to the diff

the reaction torque as it tries to turn

the wheels it tries to lift and those of

the diff and if you're holding notes

that if down with an entire engine it's

not going anywhere whereas if you're

trying to hold it down with a rubber

mount in the front the NVH guys want to

make that rubber round soft and the

powertrain guys want to make it stiff

and you end up with this compromise in

this backlash so this this is a big a

lot of work to make throttle response

better but responsiveness is kind of

what this car is all about if you take

these cars apart and put them back

together all the time like like I do the

shape of the powerplant frame is a lot

better on these cars it's a lot easier

to put it in and out it's better at the

factory it's better to service the early

ones you had to put one long bolt

through a big C shaped thing and there

were all kinds of tight clearances and

it was just a nightmare and this was a Z

shape with short bolts at the top of the

bottom and we're getting into the weeds

there but that really made life a lot

easier

both at the factory and at the racetrack

so I appreciate that being at the

racetrack moving back and look at the

rear suspension alright so back

underneath the the back of the car now

you'll see one of the biggest changes

from the NA and MB is those cars had a

relatively simple double wishbone

suspension pretty straightforward no tow

change or anything weird stuff going on

this gets a lot more complicated this is

a five link again kind of almost

straight out of the arc sate though all

the parts are a little bit smaller a

little bit lighter it's impossible to

look at a five link suspension to figure

out what's going on but it's

functionally a lot like a double

wishbone and that you have a lot of

camber gain under compression so as the

body rolls it cancels that out but it

adds in the ability to add anti squat

and anti dive geometry and

to-- change under role and also to tune

separately the sort of the way the toe

changes from role in the way the toe

changes from a lateral force from the

tire so you have sort of this kinematic

toe change is what we talk about when

when the suspension moves through its

stroke and compliance to change when the

when the bushings compress he gives a

lot more tuning options i think that was

the idea behind adopting at the rx-8 and

then again this was largely conceptually

carried over from the rx-8 one of the

weird things that you see in this car is

the way the spring and shock is mounted

to the upright which is good because it

moves directly one the one with the

wheel but the reason they did this is

this puts this big cantilever twisting

force on here that preloads the bushings

in one direction and bushings rubber

bushings are not really linear in their

spring rate they've got a relatively

linear spot in the middle then as you

get to the ends they get a lot stiffer

and pre-loading the bushings in one

direction kind of put instead of putting

the bushing right in the middle of its

of its range it would put it off to one

side and the cornering loads would push

it back across here so it basically

extended the the linear range of the

bushings behavior by putting that weird

twisting force just from the weight of

the car you'll also see of course we

have the rear uprights are aluminum

they've been steel on the old ones you

know fancy stuff like the drive shafts

are hollow which makes them stiffer

again for better throttle response

because you get a larger diameter

without adding a bunch of extra weight

and that's about all I can think of

underneath the car so why don't we just

go up under the hood and talk about the

engine now

all right so we're up under the hood

here on the NC and the first thing you

notice as well it's a lot of plastic in

there this was a big leap again over the

the NA and M be the NB had a 1.8 liter

that was based on a really old design it

had been evolved and involved in vaults

right so this was a Mazda mzr

engine family which on the Ford side of

the planet was a duratec I never this

engine was developed before my time it

was it was you know fresh and in

production when I started here but I I

kept trying to trace the lineage back of

this engine to figure out who actually

designed it and everybody was taking

credit for it it was it was really good

engine family the you know Ford did a

lot of the work on it obviously

apparently it had been a design that was

sitting in around at Mazda long before

that I heard some rumor about Yamaha

being involved but I never saw any

evidence of that anyway good motor it

made more power when it debuted in the

NC then the old n B turbo did so no

complaints about the loss of the turbo

when this came out this engine family of

course you know was in a bunch of

different stuff there's a bunch of

motorsports support for it especially in

Europe so you can do an amazing amount

of stuff with this car if you look at

all the sort of crossover stuff for this

powertrain you'll notice the engine is

really shoved far back in the chassis

there was a lot of work to get this

thing as low and as far back as possible

to the point where if you want to do

anything on the back of the engine the

first thing you do is you have to take

off the windshield wipers because the

whole cowl has to come apart in this

whole panel in the middle of the

firewall has to unbolt just to get to

the back of it not as hard as it sounds

but it sort of serves the level of

commitment to get the center of gravity

where it needs to be so this car is

actually an NC to the engine looks the

same element c1 an in situ but there

were a lot of changes internally to beef

it up and this is where you start seeing

sort of funny differences in the way

that we look at the car on the sort of

receiving end and tuning into the car

versus how it is on the development and

this car got a forged crank and and and

forged rods and stronger internals and

the reason for that was for ndh

strangely you think it's to make the

crank stronger and the car can handle

more power but of course we're not

building the car with any more power

it's got the amount of power it's got

but a forged crank is stiffer and a lot

of engine noise comes from resonance of

the reciprocating parts and actually the

engine does sound smoother and feel

better with a forged crank so it is a

legitimate NVH improvement to put a

forged crank in the car it just happens

to benefit those of us who like to

hotrod things so it's a little insight

into into the way we with the way we

justify doing cool things

[Applause]

and I think a lot of it is just the the

determination that we are going to go

against what people expect a lot of

companies would give up not only at the

engineering level on this car but the

concept level we're like over we can't

make a sports car with a 170 horsepower

that's crazy that's not enough it needs

to have 350 right well you often do

equity different world at that point so

the the to focus on having the car not

have impressive numbers but have a

feeling is so hardwired into la maza

does that's what we do with everything

or focus on the way the car feels and

that I think frees us up to sort of

approach things from it from a different

direction don't get me wrong

the engineering horsepower behind every

detail of this car is pretty damn

impressive but a lot of it is just the

willingness to go on that knob just

willing it's a eagerness to go in a

different direction than everybody else
